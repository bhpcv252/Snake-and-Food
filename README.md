# Snake-and-Food
Snake and Food is a traditional "Snake" game written in JavaScript and comes with some new features.  

### Food
There are two types of food.  
* Normal food : It increases the length of snake and score.
* Special food : Special food comes in the view when the snake length is very long. It decreases the length of the snake by some numbers but it increases the score.

### Score
Scores are dynamic. It depends on the time, location of food, and speed of snake. The more difficult to grab the food , the more high score you'll get.
